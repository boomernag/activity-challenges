# UX

## User Stories

### As a user of this platform, I will be able to:

- Find challenges, activate them and mark them as completed.
- Create a challenge.
- Edit a challenge.
- Delete a challenge.
- See activated challenge.
- See how long time a challenge is supposed to need to be completed.
- See how many times a challenge has been completed.

## Design

This project was developed with an idea of keeping it simple, keeping the challenges and its content in focus.
Bold titles for the challenges to help them stick out, a cursive title in the navbar for the page to get the "active" feeling.
Hover-effect on "activat"-button to get the feeling that it is hanging in the air and when user clicks it is showtime.

### Typography

- The body font used is **Roboto**. Good readability and working well on smaller screens.
- The "Challenges"-title is a condensed version of **Roboto**. It keeps the feeling of simplicity while helping the tile be caught by the eye.

### Colours

<img src="https://github.com/boomernag/activity-challenges/blob/170137cdfa22204c2c7fd07d034948bcb8f86263/static/img/Color%20Scheme.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" alt="Color Scheme">
- In the colour scheme, I used orange a base as it is an "active" color.
- In the navbar and footer, I used the darkgray-ish background with letters in white, giving a nice frame for the page and also easily readible letters.
- In the background, I kept it simple with white (after trying both dark and bright)
- The page title got the orange color that looks clean but still adds that color spark to make the page more visually attractive.
- Challenge-activate button got the "start"-lightseagreen color and the deactivate button got the "stop"-red color.

### Icons

The icons used in this project are provided by [Font Awesome 5.12.1](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Materialize_1.0.0](https://https://materializecss.com/icons.html).
They were used for displaying: challenge time and completions, search function aswell as challenge edit- and delete buttons.

## Wireframes

These wireframes were designed with Balsamiq Mockups 3. These were the first version of scope and some minor things have changed during the development for the final version.

# Features

## Existing Features

### Base

All pages have the navigation bar with the logo and all visible links and footer.

- **Landing page**
<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/boomernag/activity-challenges/blob/170137cdfa22204c2c7fd07d034948bcb8f86263/static/img/Landing%20Page%20%28all%20devices%29.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" alt="Landing paage (all devices)">
</div>

The page does not have a login functionality, which is set for future feature. So for now if a challenge is activated, it is active for everyone. Same goes for deactivating/completing a challenge.

### Add a challenge

<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/boomernag/activity-challenges/blob/170137cdfa22204c2c7fd07d034948bcb8f86263/static/img/Add%20Challenge%20%28all%20devices%29.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" width="400" alt="Add Challenge (add devices)>
</div>

**CRUD - CREATE**
When entering the "Add Challenge" page user is provided three(3) inputs - [Title, Description and Time].
It is required to provide a title and description of minimum five(5) letters each aswell as choosing a time alternative.

### Activated Challenges

<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/boomernag/activity-challenges/blob/25e19967e1a3c888cce5425a2f0d94398436ca72/static/img/Activated%20Challenges%20%28Home%29%20%28all%20devices%29.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" width="400" alt="Active Challenges (all devices)">
</div>

**CRUD - READ**
User can easily see which challenges that are activated by going to "Home" button in navbar. As mentioned, future feature is that activated challenges will be personal.
User can also search for challenge by title or description.

### Edit challenge

<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/boomernag/activity-challenges/blob/25e19967e1a3c888cce5425a2f0d94398436ca72/static/img/Update%20Challenge%20%28all%20devices%29.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" width="400" alt="Edit Challenge (all devices)">
</div>

**CRUD - UPDATE**
When a challenge is not activated it is possible to be edited. User will then face the current information when enter that challenge edit page.
If changing, the information will be overwritten by the new input and also the completions will be set to 0 (as there might be a different kind of challenge).

### Delete Challenge

<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/boomernag/activity-challenges/blob/25e19967e1a3c888cce5425a2f0d94398436ca72/static/img/Delete%20Challenge.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener" width="450" alt="Delete Challenge (gif)">
</div>

**CRUD - DELETE**
When clicking the delete button the challenge will be deleted. Atm there is no validation or confirmation when the button is clicked but it is a future feature.

### Error Page

For 500 and 404 errors the user will be redirected to landing page and a flash message of "Challenge does not exist" will be displayed.

## Features Left to Implement

- The next steps are:
    - Implement feature to have a personal database to see only users own activated challenges, how many challenges user has completed and added.
    - Further develop the search index to be more flexible and also add filters that user can filter challenges by.
    - Implement a timer user can use when activating a challenge so that is automatically completes when the designated time for the challenge is up.
    - Be able to add challenges to a cluster that is activated after one another when the cluster is started.
    - Recommend challenges to other users.
    - Create a general feed to show who completed a challenge.
    - Possiblity to add other users as "friends" and see their feed.
    - Create a group of friends that can be included in a cluster of challenges, so when the cluster starts it starts for every one who is part of that group.
    - Add media to challenges to visually describe how the challenge is supposed to be performed.

# Testing

- I have thorougly tested differents possibilities of breaking the code and created solutions for when it happened. 
    - One of those things were when a challenge title that didn't exist was inserted into the url search field. That was fixed by adding an errorhandler for 500 error.
    - If a random text is inserted into the url or is misspelled that creates a 404 error user is redirected to landing page and a flash message is displayed.
    - When a challenge is in edit mode in one tab and then deleted in another, edit function is unavailable and user is redirected to landing page and a flash message is displayed.
    - When a challenge is in edit mode in one tab and then activated in another, edit function is unavailable and user is redirected to landing page and a flash message is displayed.-

  e.g

```
MONGO_URI="insert your mongo URI details here"
SECRET_KEY="insert your secret key here"
```

- Create a database in MongoDB Atlas called **challengedb** with a collection called **challenges**

- Run the application with the command

```
python3 app.py
```

## Remote Deployment

#### Instructions

To deploy this app to Heroku you need to follow the steps below:

- Create a **requirements.txt** file so that Heroku can install all the dependencies required to run the app.
  `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

- Create a **Procfile** with the command:
  `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`

- In this step, you have to create a free account on the [Heroku website](https://signup.heroku.com/).
- Login to the account, click on new and then create a new app. In the following screen, you need to give a name and choose the Europe region.
- In the menu access the **Deploy** option, after that click on Connect to Github. Just below provide the information from the app's repository on GitHub and select the option Enable Automatic Deploy.
